Today's Question - An old Sr. Partner decided to really test a hotshot job applicant.  He said - "My son is 24 years 
younger than I am.  My grandson is 25 years younger than my son.  My age plus my grandson's age equals 73 
years.  If you want the job tell me how old I am."  Well??

proposed they race again but Bob should start 10 yards back.  Thus Bob had to run 110 yards while Ross ran 100.  
All things being equal - who won?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - It would take 9 painters to paint 270 landscapes in 30 days.

Today's Question - It was for a good cause anyway – With a break in the artic chill, half the floor turned out to 
watch a charity mini-marathon.  The runners were Mike, Pete, Rich, Dan and Ed.  Mike finished in front of Pete

Today's Question - Around the water cooler there was a great debate about who made the best calzone - a meat 
and cheese filled baked item.  They agreed to each bring samples Tuesday.  Sam brought some.  Jack brought 
one more than that.  Harry brought one more than Jack.  Bob missed his train and showed up empty handed.  He 
said he'd pay for his share.  The four of them split the 12 calzones evenly.  They figured each calzone was worth 
a dollar.  Who paid what to whom?

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - For there to be 12 calzones, Sam must have brought 3; Jack 4; and Harry 5.  Divided equally (3 pies apiece) that meant Bob paid $3 - $1 to Jack and $2 to Harry.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2020-02-06-2020-02-06.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2020-02-06-2020-02-06.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2020-02-06-2020-02-06.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2020-02-06-2020-02-06.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2020-02-06-2020-02-06.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - In a small county election there were four candidates: Larry, Charles, Sal and Ivan.  The total 
votes cast were 8,341.  Larry won beating Sal by 560 votes, beating Charles by 830 and Ivan by 981.  How many 
votes did each candidate get? 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - To find how many votes each one got take the total vote (1841) and add each of the spreads between the winner and each loser (560 + 830 + 981).  That total (10712) would be the votes cast if the others had tied Larry.  Now divide by 4 to find out how many votes Larry got (2678).  Now subtract the spreads in the question, giving: Sal = 2118; Charles = 1848; and Ivan 1697.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2020-02-04-2020-02-04.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2020-02-04-2020-02-04.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2020-02-04-2020-02-04.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2020-02-04-2020-02-04.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2020-02-04-2020-02-04.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - "Don't hold dinner dear!"  Timothy can't get his car started so he grabs a train, which takes 
him halfway home at a speed 20 times faster than he walks.  As he gets off the train, he twists his ankle and 
must ride the rest of the way in a farmers cart which travels half as fast as he walks.  Would he have been home 
sooner or later if he had walked all the way.  (You don't need a calculator.) 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - No Algebra needed.  If the farmers cart took Timothy half the distance at half the speed of walking, that took as much time as walking the whole way, so the train trip was wasted.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2020-01-28-2020-01-28.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2020-01-28-2020-01-28.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2020-01-28-2020-01-28.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2020-01-28-2020-01-28.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2020-01-28-2020-01-28.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Hey!  Wait a minute!  This ruler has no numbers on it! - Here's the old 3 bottle puzzle with a 
twist. - The 3 bottles have 3 shapes - round, square, and Bowl.  The square holds 3 pints more than the bowl 
shaped.  The round bottle  holds 4  pints more than the square shaped.   How could you use these  3 bottles to 
measure exactly 1 quart of water into a pail?  (Hint: It's less than 10 moves but remember you do not know the 
full capacity of any of the bottles.) 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - The quart can be found in 9 moves. 1) Fill the square with water. 2) Fill the bowl shape from the square bottle.  3) Empty the bowl onto the ground.  4) Pour what's left in square into the round. 5) Fill the square bottle again. 6) Fill the bowl with water from the square  7) Pour what's left in the square into the round. 8) Fill the square  bottle  with  water  again.    9)  Fill  the  round  bottle  with  what  is  in  the  square  bottle.    What  is  left  in  the square bottle should be 1 quart.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2020-01-13-2020-01-13.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2020-01-13-2020-01-13.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2020-01-13-2020-01-13.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2020-01-13-2020-01-13.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2020-01-13-2020-01-13.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner Answer - It was a bit of a trick question - but not too tricky for most of you.  If you pick up pail #2 and empty it into pail #5 and replace the now empty pail #2 - you get the requisite full/empty/full rotation.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2020-01-09-2020-01-09.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2020-01-09-2020-01-09.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2020-01-09-2020-01-09.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2020-01-09-2020-01-09.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2020-01-09-2020-01-09.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Little Linda started her Christmas shopping.  When she came home, she told mom that half 
her money was gone in the first hour.  It was then that she noticed that she now had as many cents as she had 
dollars when she started but she had only half as many dollars as she had cents when she began.  How much did 
she spend?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - Little Linda must have started with $99.98.  Spending half would leave her with $49.99 or the same number of cents as had been dollars and dollars equaling half the number of original cents.   \x0c   Cashin\xe2\x80\x99s Comments  December 18, 2019 Page 3 of 3  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2019-12-17-2019-12-17.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2019-12-17-2019-12-17.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2019-12-17-2019-12-17.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2019-12-17-2019-12-17.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2019-12-17-2019-12-17.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>
