Today's  Question  –  Bob  asked  Ron  when  he  had  bought  the  champagne  for  the  New  Year’s  party.    Ron 
responded with a puzzle  –  “It was not the day after Monday or the day  before Thursday and  it wouldn’t have 
been Sunday the next day nor was it Sunday the day before, and the day after the next day wasn’t Saturday and 
the day before the day before wasn’t Wednesday.”  What day of the week did Ron buy the Bubbly?

Today's Question - "Where's Santa when you need him."  -  Little Dick and Jane went to the neighborhood five and 
dime to get a Christmas present for mom.  Dick saw a shiny comb and took it to the register with all his money.  
"Sorry little boy", said the cashier.  "You are 24 cents short!"  Jane smiled a sibling grin, grabbed the comb and put 
it, along with all her money on the counter.  "Sorry, little girl", said the cashier, "but you are 2 cents short."  After 
an exchange of ugly faces, they agreed to pool their money.  However, the cashier told them that they still didn't 
have enough.  How much did Dick have?  Jane...? and how much was the comb?  (No taxes involved.)

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - Sanjo, that clever little elf, knew he should take a ribbon from the drawer marked "Red and Green".  If it is green it must contain all green ribbon (since all drawer labels are incorrect).  Therefore, the drawer marked Red will contain red and green while the drawer marked Green will be red.  Now, try to put hex grommet A over flex blot C - batteries not included.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2014-12-05-2014-12-05.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2014-12-05-2014-12-05.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2014-12-05-2014-12-05.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2014-12-05-2014-12-05.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2014-12-05-2014-12-05.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Hats off to you - A group of 10 cadets are on their way to the Army - Navy Game when a gust 
of  wind  blows  all  their  hats  off.    A  quick  footed  young  man  scoops  them  up  and  hands  them  back  randomly.  
What are the odds that exactly 9 of them received the correct hat? 
 
Further  Goldwynims  -  "I'll  believe  in  this  color  television  when  I  see  it  in  black  and  white!"  -  "If  I  could  drop 
dead right now, I'd be the happiest man alive." - "I'm willing to admit I may not be right all the time…..but I'm 
never wrong." - "A verbal contract ain't worth the paper it's written on." 
 
And  Three  Classic  Stengelisms  -  "They  say  you  can't  do  it…..but  sometimes  it  doesn't  always  work."    And 
"Three  things  can  happen  when  you  play  baseball.    You  can  win.    You  can  lose.    Or  it  can  rain.”    Lastly,  my 
favorite Casey line – "The key to leadership is to keep the guys who hate you away from the guys who haven't 
made up their mind yet."

Today's Question - Late for Thanksgiving dinner, Bob called the baker to see how many pumpkin pies he had left.  
The overworked baker snapped  - "I  have 3/4's of the total plus 3/4's of one pie."   Assuming  he sold only whole 
pies, how many did he have?

Not at first  of  course  -  the  First  Thanksgiving  was  a  three-day  event.    Then  for  many  decades  it  was  different  days  in different places.  Finally, New Englanders put it on "Lecture Day" (Thursday) to avoid conflict with the Sabbath but keep a religious note.  (Lecture Day was that day of week when preachers would circulate to read or lecture to the people.  Sometimes the preacher was not a trained and ordained minister.  Rather he might be the only one in the village who could read and write.  That made him the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to go to for help and advice.  The 16th and 17th century British pronunciation of \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d sounded liked \xe2\x80\x9cparson\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xa6.a name we find synonymous with preacher.) George  Washington  kept  the  tradition  when  he  declared  the  first  national  Thanksgiving  and  most  Presidents followed  suit.    Finally,  FDR  and  Congress  wrote  it  into  law  as  the  fourth  Thursday  in  November  to  lengthen  the Christmas Shopping Season coming out of the Depression.   \x0c   Cashin\xe2\x80\x99s Comments    November 25, 2014 Page 3 of 3  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2014-11-20-2014-11-20.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2014-11-20-2014-11-20.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2014-11-20-2014-11-20.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2014-11-20-2014-11-20.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2014-11-20-2014-11-20.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today’s  Question  -  "Just  watch  the  road  will  you!"    Smiling  Sal  is  driving  on  the  road  between  Tedium  and 
Oblivion.  He is driving at a steady speed.  He notes that every three minutes he meets a bus coming toward him 
and every six minutes a bus overtakes him.  How often do the buses leave from the terminal in each town? 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer  -  The  buses  have  an  even  schedule  (as  buses  often  do).    Because  he  is  moving  toward  the  oncoming buses he sees more of them (naturally).   So....in an hour he sees 20 oncoming (three minutes) and 10 overtaking (six minutes).  So that's 30 in an hour.  If he were stopped, he would see 15 from either direction.  Therefore, the buses leave every four minutes (60 minutes \xef\x82\xb8 15).  I wish I was on that route.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2014-11-14-2014-11-14.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2014-11-14-2014-11-14.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2014-11-14-2014-11-14.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2014-11-14-2014-11-14.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2014-11-14-2014-11-14.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - In the series: "Divide, Orator, Avenue, Animal, Safari" the odd one out is Avenue since it is the only one that does not continue to alternate vowels and consonants.

Today's Question - A monk named Sandy - In teaching his class in Medieval thinking, Brother Eric begins class at 
9:00 a.m. by setting a 5 hour hourglass on the window sill.  Later when no one is looking, impish novice Sean 
turns the hourglass over.  At 11:30 Abbot Art notices the hourglass looks off and returns it to its original posture.  
Finally, at 3:00 p.m. the sand runs out and amid student grumbles, the class ends.  What time did novice Sean 
turn the glass? 
 
 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - The class ran an hour longer than it would have if novice Sean had left things alone (9 + 5 hours = 2:00).  Therefore,  half  of  that  hour  it  was  going  the  wrong  way  and  the  other  half  hour  correcting.    Since  the  Abbot returned it at 11:30, then Sean must have pulled his prank at 11:00 - one half hour earlier.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2014-11-07-2014-11-07.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2014-11-07-2014-11-07.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2014-11-07-2014-11-07.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2014-11-07-2014-11-07.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2014-11-07-2014-11-07.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - If the farmers cart took Timothy half the distance at half the speed of walking that took as much time as walking the whole way, so the train trip was wasted.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2014-11-03-2014-11-03.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2014-11-03-2014-11-03.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2014-11-03-2014-11-03.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2014-11-03-2014-11-03.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2014-11-03-2014-11-03.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - A kid's trick for Halloween – Mike gave Bob a nickel and a dime.  He said  - "Put one in each 
hand but don't tell me.  Now....triple the value of the coin in your right hand and double the value in your left.  Add 
those two values together and tell me if the total is "odd" or "even" and I'll tell you which coin is in which hand."  
What would be the placement for "even?" 
 
 
 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - Guess which hand! - If the total is "even", the nickel must be in the hand that is doubled.....in this case the "left hand."  If the nickel were tripled (15 cents), the answer will always be odd.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2014-10-31-2014-10-31.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2014-10-31-2014-10-31.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2014-10-31-2014-10-31.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2014-10-31-2014-10-31.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2014-10-31-2014-10-31.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>
