Today's Question - An encore classic to prepare for the holiday season - Ann is stranded in a mountain cabin with 
her husband who has just been bitten by a venomous snake.  Just before the phone went dead, the doctor told 
her the only way to save him was with a poultice that must be boiled exactly 15 minutes (no more, no less).  Ann 
has  no  watch,  clock,  radio  or  other  means  to  time  things.    She  does  have  2  mini-hour  glasses,  one  runs  11 
minutes, the other runs 7 minutes.  How does she time 15 minutes exactly?

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - Some opted for the easy - Start both together.  When 7 ran out, start the boiling.  When 11 runs out (4 minutes), turn over and get 11 more (15 minutes).  The fallacy here is that you can boil at any instant you choose.  You really have to wait till the boiling process is ready.  Okay, once the poultice is ready to boil start both the 7 minute and 11 minute timers.  When the 7 minutes is done turn it over.  (Elapsed time 7 minutes.)  When the 11 minutes is done turn the 7 over again.  (There will be exactly 4 minutes in the bottom before you turn it over.  So when that runs out the 15 minutes are up.  11 minutes + 4 minutes = 15).  More fun than SAT's huh?  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2019-12-05-2019-12-05.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2019-12-05-2019-12-05.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2019-12-05-2019-12-05.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2019-12-05-2019-12-05.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2019-12-05-2019-12-05.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Answer  -  The  state  capitals  that  begin  with  the  same  letter  as  their  states  are:  Dover  (Delaware);  Honolulu 
(Hawaii); Indianapolis (Indiana); Oklahoma City (Oklahoma). 
 
Today’s Question – A brag gone bad.  Da boys were talking about how they were still in shape.  Some claimed 
they were still at “wrestling weight” and could run as fast and jump as high as in their youth.  One pot-bellied 
participant challenged the loudest claimant.  “Okay, hot shot.  Give me that ballpoint pen in your pocket and I’ll 
bet you $20 that you are in such bad shape you can’t jump over it.”  He got the pen, put it on the floor and won 
the bet.  It was very easy.  Do you know how?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer \xe2\x80\x93 Folks tried lots of zany planning on the \xe2\x80\x9cpen jump\xe2\x80\x9d question.  The answer to the riddle (from second grade, as I recall) is to put the pen on the floor right against the wall.

Today's Question - Capital Punishment - We already know you memorized the state capitals in grammar school.  
So, you should be able to answer this without looking anything up.  There are four state capitals that begin with 
the same letter as their state.  What are they?

Today's Corner 
 
Answer - Thanksgiving is on a Thursday because - Well in a way - because that's when the Pilgrims had it.  Not at 
first  of  course  -  the  First  Thanksgiving  was  a  three-day  event.   Then  for  many  decades  it  was  different  days  in 
different places.  Finally, New Englanders put it on "Lecture Day" (Thursday) to avoid conflict with the Sabbath 
but keep a religious note.  (Lecture Day was that day of week when preachers would circulate to read or lecture 
to the people.  Sometimes the preacher was not a trained and ordained minister.  Rather he might be the only 
one in the village who could read and write.  That made him the “person” to go to for help and advice.  The 
16th and 17th century British pronunciation of “person” sounded liked “parson”….a name we find synonymous 
with  preacher.)  Washington  kept  the  tradition  when  he  declared  the  first  national  Thanksgiving  and  most 
Presidents  followed  suit.    Finally,  FDR  and  Congress  wrote  it  into  law  as  the  fourth  Thursday  in  November  to 
lengthen the Christmas Shopping Season coming out of the Depression. 
 
Today’s Question - Is that with stuffing or without?  If a turkey weighs 8 pounds plus one-third its own weight – 
how much does it weigh? 

A Rather Recent Thanksgiving Tradition At The Cashin Household - The original recipe for “White Castle 
Stuffing”  was  sent  to  me  by  my  friend,  Steve  Leuthold  and  his  team  in  Minneapolis.    Another  friend,  Bo 
O’Connell  modified  it  for  the  East  Coast  taste.    It’s  actually  quite  tasty  and  tends  to  spur  conversations  and 
memories around the table.  
 
Here is Bo’s version of White Castle Thanksgiving Stuffing: 
 
First  things  first,  go  to  White  Castle  on  Wednesday  night  around  8:00  p.m.    Pick  up  two  crave  cases  of 
Hamburgers (makes two trays).  Put crave cases in fridge and we’ll start in the morning.

Cashin’s Comments 

 

 
I like to quarter burgers with a knife rather than tearing.  Put into a large mixing bowl.  Add celery and sprinkle 
seasonings than mix.  Add broth and mix again.  Put in tines.  Slide in oven and warm to liking.

Today's Question – Bobby was looking at a piece of property up in the "Vineyard".  It was subject to a 99 year 
lease.    How  much  time  is  left,  he  asked.    The  less  than  friendly  leaseholder  said  "Two-thirds  of  the  time  past 
equals four-fifths of the time yet to go."  How much time is left on the lease?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - The centuries old refrain was - "Twice four and twenty blackbirds were sitting on a plain.  I shot and killed a seventh part.  How many did remain?".  Even then (or especially then) riddles involved trickery.  So the clue could be interpreted a couple of ways.  "Twice four and twenty"......could be "2 times 4 plus twenty" or 2 times "4 and 20 (24)".  Obviously to make the riddle work it was "2 times 4" plus twenty (or 28).  So...."I shot and killed a seventh part (1/7)....How many did remain?"  Thus (2x4) + 20 = 28 of which 1/7 = 4 and whether shot by gun or arrow only the dead would remain = 4.....Phew!!  So much for old, old riddles!!  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2019-11-11-2019-11-11.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2019-11-11-2019-11-11.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2019-11-11-2019-11-11.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2019-11-11-2019-11-11.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2019-11-11-2019-11-11.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - A monk named Sandy - In teaching his class in Medieval thinking, Brother Eric begins class at 
9:00 a.m. by setting a 5 hour hourglass on the window sill.  Later when no one is looking, impish novice Sean 
turns the hourglass over.  At 11:30 Abbot Art notices the hourglass looks off and returns it to its original posture.  
Finally, at 3:00 p.m. the sand runs out and amid student grumbles, the class ends.  What time did novice Sean 
turn the glass? 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - The class ran an  hour  longer than  it would  have if novice Sean had left things alone  (9 + 5 hours  = 2:00).  Therefore, half of that hour it was going the wrong way and the other half hour correcting.

Today's Question - This is too cheesy for par - At a post-Halloween party, Tucker rattled three dice in a cup.  
When he rolled, the total on the three dice was a two digit number.  The number on top of one of the dice was 
the sum of two digits in the total.  The numbers on the bottoms of the other two dice were the two digits of the 
total.  What did Tucker throw?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - First let's repeat the question - This is too cheesy for par - At a  post-Halloween party, Tucker rattled three dice in a cup.  When he rolled, the total on the three dice was a two digit number.  The number on top of one of the dice was the sum of two digits in the total.  The numbers on the bottoms of the other two dice were the two digits of the total.  What did Tucker throw?  Okay, so if the two digits in the total are represented on the bottom of two dice, we know they must be digits from 1 through 6. Thus the universe of 2 digit possibilities is 11 through 16.  One of the components is the sum of the two digits.  The other components are equal to 7 minus one of the digits (opposite sides of a die add up to 7).  Therefore, the total is 14 and the components are 5, 6, 3.  See it's easy!!  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2019-11-05-2019-11-05.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2019-11-05-2019-11-05.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2019-11-05-2019-11-05.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2019-11-05-2019-11-05.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2019-11-05-2019-11-05.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Murray the Master Meatloaf Maker was whipping up some of his famous "mini-loafs" for a 
card  game  ("Smoker's  Poker").    He  usually  made  enough  so  that  each  player  got  three.    But  today  he 
absentmindedly  made  more.    So,  when  Jake  and  James  made  a  surprise  appearance,  there  was  still  enough.  
Leaving Murray out of the equation, now each person got two.  How many mini-loafs did Murray make and how 
many smokers were originally invited? 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer  -  To  Murray's  Smoker's  Poker  and  the  mini  meatloaf  confusion.    If  all  had  two  apiece,  then  the  two surprise guests ate a total of four.  Since that reduced the other players from three to two (net loss of one each), the four loafs meant four players.  And there were twelve mini-loafs (4 x 3) shared by the guests.
