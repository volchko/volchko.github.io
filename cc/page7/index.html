been Sunday the next day nor was it Sunday the day before, and the day after the next day wasn’t Saturday and 
the day before the day before wasn’t Wednesday.”  What day of the week did Ron buy the Bubbly?

Answer - The Three Kings were: Melchior, Caspar and Balthazar - bringing Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh. 
Melchior  (Emperor  of  Arabia  =  gold);  Caspar  (King  of  Tharsis  =  Frankincense)  and  Balthazar  (King  of 
Ethiopia = Myrrh).  Their names and identities did not appear in general circulation until centuries after the 
first "Epiphany."

Sanjo  discovered  that  the  ambitious  elf,  Lanzro  had  switched  the  labels  on  the  3  ribbon  drawers.    They  were 
labeled: "Red", "Green" and "Red and Green".  Since every drawer was incorrectly marked, how can Sanjo pick 
just one ribbon out of one drawer and know which drawer held which?

Today's Question - How many Articles of Impeachment did the House Judiciary Committee actually note against 
President Nixon?? 
 
Further Goldwynims - "I'll believe in this color television when I see it in black and white!" - "If I could drop 
dead right now, I'd be the happiest man alive." - "I'm willing to admit I may not be right all the time…..but I'm 
never wrong." - "A verbal contract ain't worth the paper it's written on." 
 
And Three Classic Stengelisms  -  "They  say  you  can't  do  it…..but  sometimes  it  doesn't  always  work."    And 
"Three  things  can  happen  when  you  play  baseball.    You  can  win.    You  can  lose.    Or  it  can  rain.”    Lastly,  my 
favorite Casey line – "The key to leadership is to keep the guys who hate you away from the guys who haven't 
made up their mind yet."

Today's Question - An old refrain - "Twice four and twenty blackbirds were sitting on a plain.  I shot and killed a 
seventh part.  How many did remain?" 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - The centuries old refrain was - "Twice four and twenty blackbirds were sitting on a plain.  I shot and killed a seventh part.  How many did remain?".  Even then (or especially then) riddles involved trickery.  So the clue could be interpreted a couple of ways.  "Twice four and twenty"......could be "2 times 4 plus twenty" or 2 times "4 and 20 (24)".  Obviously to make the riddle work it was "2 times 4" plus twenty (or 28).  So...."I shot and killed a seventh part (1/7)....How many did remain?"  Thus (2x4) + 20 = 28 of which 1/7 = 4 and whether shot by gun or arrow only the dead would remain = 4.....Phew!!

Today's Question - A kid's trick for Halloween – Mike gave Bob a nickel and a dime.  He said - "Put one in each 
hand but don't tell me.  Now....triple the value of the coin in your right hand and double the value in your left.  
Add those two values together and tell me if the total is "odd" or "even" and I'll tell you which coin is in which 
hand."  What would be the placement for "even?" 
 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - Guess which hand! - If the total is "even", the nickel must be in the hand that is doubled.....in this case the "left hand."  If the nickel were tripled (15 cents), the answer will always be odd.  \x0c   Cashin\xe2\x80\x99s Comments  October 31, 2018 Page 3 of 3      8 __ 2 __ 12 __ 9 = 39  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2018-10-30-2018-10-30.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2018-10-30-2018-10-30.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2018-10-30-2018-10-30.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2018-10-30-2018-10-30.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2018-10-30-2018-10-30.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>
