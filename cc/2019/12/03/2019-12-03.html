Today's Question - Capital Punishment - We already know you memorized the state capitals in grammar school.  
So, you should be able to answer this without looking anything up.  There are four state capitals that begin with 
the same letter as their state.  What are they?  
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer  -  The  state  capitals  that  begin  with  the  same  letter  as  their  states  are:  Dover  (Delaware);  Honolulu (Hawaii); Indianapolis (Indiana); Oklahoma City (Oklahoma).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s Question \xe2\x80\x93 A brag gone bad.  Da boys were talking about how they were still in shape.  Some claimed they were still at \xe2\x80\x9cwrestling weight\xe2\x80\x9d and could run as fast and jump as high as in their youth.  One pot-bellied participant challenged the loudest claimant.  \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, hot shot.  Give me that ballpoint pen in your pocket and I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you $20 that you are in such bad shape you can\xe2\x80\x99t jump over it.\xe2\x80\x9d  He got the pen, put it on the floor and won the bet.  It was very easy.  Do you know how?
