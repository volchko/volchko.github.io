Today's Question - (Car 54....Where Are You?)  Bob left Scranton at 8:15 a.m. headed for Philadelphia via the PA. 
Turnpike.  He drove at a speed of 40 mph.  At 8:30 he stopped for 10 minutes to get coffee then resumed at 40 
MPH.  Al left Philly at 8:45 headed for Scranton via the PA. Turnpike.  He traveled at 60 mph.  When they met 
enroute, who was closer to Scranton?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer  -  Nice  try  to  all  who  used  calculus,  advanced  algebra  or  even  rulers  to  compute  the  answer  to  the Philly/Scranton  puzzle.    The  question  was  -  who  was  closer  when  they  met?   Since  they would  both  be  in  the same place when they met, neither would be closer.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2017-05-15-2017-05-15.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-05-15-2017-05-15.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2017-05-15-2017-05-15.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-05-15-2017-05-15.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2017-05-15-2017-05-15.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Which wheel travels farther on a bicycle - the front or the back?? 
 
Bonus Question - What is the only U.S. state with no caves?? 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - in ordinary usage the front wheel of a bicycle travels further.  This has to do with its turning function which requires it to transcribe a larger area than the captive rear wheel.  Bonus Answer - the only state without caves is Rhode Island.

Today's Question - The Mid-Hoboken Birth of Baseball Museum is not exactly Disney World.  On one recent but 
rare warm Spring day the ticket seller passed out 100 tickets.  Being an old, sexist place they charged Men - $5; 
Women - $2 and children under 12 paid 10 cents apiece.  If the day's receipts totaled $100, what was the visitor 
mix?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - The Museum Master says that the 100 attendees for $100 resulted from a group of 11 men, 19 women and 70 children.  He also noted that the mix may have been impacted by the fact that Hoboken has had 240 bars in its square mile of territory.

Today's Question - Talk about dysfunctional families - at the mini-reunion there was an aunt, uncle, niece, 
nephew, cousin, sister, brother, daughter, son, father and mother.  The puzzle is there are only two women and

possible?

Today’s  Question  -  Sure,  but  who  takes  out  the  garbage!    Betty's  brother  has  one  more  brother  than  he  has 
sisters.    How  many  more  brothers  than  sisters  does  Betty  have?    (No  you  don't  need  to  know  the  size  of  the 
family.) 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - This was tricky.  Betty's brother had one more brother than sisters.  Betty is one of those sisters so she would have one less sister and one more brother than her brother.  So she would have three more brothers than sisters.  (Before you get upset assume two sisters - including Betty - and four brothers.  See that works.)  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2017-04-12-2017-04-12.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-04-12-2017-04-12.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2017-04-12-2017-04-12.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-04-12-2017-04-12.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2017-04-12-2017-04-12.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - The formula for when Easter falls, as you probably know, is that it shall be the first Sunday on, or after, the first full moon following the Vernal Equinox, the first day of Spring.  It was set by the Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D. which as you remember was called by the Emperor Constantine.  Because of the formula's basis in Astronomy, Easter can never be later than April 25 nor earlier than March 22.  Passover, on the other hand is on the 15th day of the month of Nisan.  Now as you may have guessed, the Council of Nicaea suspected that not everyone's calendar, even with the picture of the two kittens climbing out of a basket, would have the month of Nisan on it.  So to avoid bothering their Jewish neighbors by asking each Spring when is the 15th of Nisan, they approximated the date with the above mentioned astronomical formula.  Since the month of Nisan always starts on a new moon (as does every month in the Jewish calendar), the 15th of the month would be at - or proximate to - a full moon.  That's why the two holidays are tied so closely together each year.  This year they are only three off from their original link.  Passover was on Thursday before the first Easter.  This year Passover begins at sundown on Monday evening.

Today's Question - Timmy ignored the advice of his mentor Danny and went to an NCAA - March Madness Party 
with an armful of brown bottles.  To his pal Anthony he gives half the bottles he has plus a half bottle.  Next, to 
his  buddy  Bernie,  he  gives  half  the  bottles  he  has  left  plus  half  a  bottle.    Realizing  that  he  can't  live  on  his 
personality  he  then  gives  half  of  what  he  has  left  plus  half  a  bottle  to  his  protector  -  Last  Call.    Timmy  then 
realizes he is out of brown bottles.  How many bottles did Tim start with??

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer  -  Since  Teddy  eats  3  times  as  fast  as  Steve,  he  would  eat  24  donuts  while  Steve  eats  8  (which  would equal the requisite 32).  That would take 45 minutes. The 40 donuts was a problem for math types.  At the 3 to 1 ratio of eating, we know Teddy will consume 30 while Steve eats 10.  In one hour, Ted eats 32 but Steve eats 10.7.  If we multiply 60 minutes by Teddy's ratio 30 \xc3\xb7 32 we get 56 minutes and 15 seconds just enough time for Steve to eat his 10.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2017-03-23-2017-03-23.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-03-23-2017-03-23.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2017-03-23-2017-03-23.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-03-23-2017-03-23.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2017-03-23-2017-03-23.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - It's in the bag - An eccentric trader took his $1,000 bonus to the bank.  He asked the teller to 
place the dollars in a series of sealed bags so that he could later ask for any amount from 1 to 1,000 and get it 
without opening any bag.  What is the smallest number of bags he would need and what amounts would in each 
bag? 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer to in the bag - There should be 10 bags in the following progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 489.  (Note the symmetry.)  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2017-03-22-2017-03-22.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-03-22-2017-03-22.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2017-03-22-2017-03-22.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-03-22-2017-03-22.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2017-03-22-2017-03-22.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today’s Question - "Your planet or mine?"  Astronaut Ron found himself safely on the planet Zilat.  There were 
two species on the planet - one set had one eye....the other 2 eyes.  One set told only the truth.  The other only 
lied.  Ron asked a single eyed alien if he was a truth teller.  The alien replied - "Zyxtrap!"  Confused, Ron asked a 
2 eyed alien what the first had said.  The 2 eyed alien, using hand signals, indicated that "Zyxtrap" meant yes but 
warned that the first alien was a liar.  Who told the truth? 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - The answer to Ron\'s first question naturally had to be "yes" whether from a liar or a truth teller.  Since the second alien said the word meant yes, he (or she) had to be a truth teller.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2017-03-21-2017-03-21.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-03-21-2017-03-21.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2017-03-21-2017-03-21.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-03-21-2017-03-21.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2017-03-21-2017-03-21.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>
