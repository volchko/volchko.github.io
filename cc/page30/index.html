Today's  Question  - Sister  Herman  Joseph  arranged  a  turtle  race  for  the  6th  grade  math  club.    There  were  13 
turtles each with a number on its shell.  During the race, she was called out of the classroom and returned to ask 
"who  won?"    The  kids  giggled  and  decided  to  give  her  a  taste  of  her  own  medicine.    A  said  "It  was  a  single 
digit".  B said "It had a zero in it".  C said "It was an even number".  D said "It was a square number".  E said "It 
was a prime number".  F said "It was an odd number".  Sister knew they couldn't all be telling the truth (she 
learned only one of the 7 did).  If "1" is not a prime and only 1,4, and 9 are squares -what turtle won? 
 

 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer  -  This  took  a  real  Sister  Herman  Joseph  to  figure  out.    You  had  to  set  a  matrix  with  the  numbers  1 through 13 across the top  and the student down the left.  Then you put an "x" in every number that fits the statement of each student.  Thus A\'s comment that it was a single digit would put an x under every number from 1 through 10.  By this process we see the only number with one x would be "12" the winning turtle.  (Sister was not happy at all.)  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-09-10-2015-09-10.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-09-10-2015-09-10.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-09-10-2015-09-10.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-09-10-2015-09-10.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-09-10-2015-09-10.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Rhymin' Simon - If an "ardent employee" is a "fervent servant", what might be the rhyming 
parallels  for:  "a  distressed  choral  group";  "an  obstreperous  cactus";  "a  loud  Congressional  group";  "a  cranky 
hack driver", and looking forward to Halloween, "Dracula and Freddy Kreuger"? 
 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - A distressed choral group might be "a dire choir"; an obstreperous cactus = "a truculent succulent"; a loud  Congressional  group  =  "a  raucous  caucus";  a  cranky  hack  driver  =  "a  crabby  cabbie"  and  Dracula  and Freddy Kreuger = "A gruesome twosome".  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-09-09-2015-09-09.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-09-09-2015-09-09.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-09-09-2015-09-09.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-09-09-2015-09-09.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-09-09-2015-09-09.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - John's backyard circus was a family success.  He sold mini-bags of salted peanuts for 8 cents a 
bag.  Uncle Tony (who could be a pain) asked how much for a bag with no salt?  John said - the peanuts cost 6 
cents more per bag than the salt.  How much should an unsalted bag cost?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - The sides of the triangle would be 13, 14, 15 and the height 12.  Thus: 12, 13, 14, 15.  Other series work for the sides but none fits the height - but of course you knew that.   <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-09-04-2015-09-04.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-09-04-2015-09-04.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-09-04-2015-09-04.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-09-04-2015-09-04.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-09-04-2015-09-04.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today’s  Question  –  Alex  was  as  usual  down  in  the  basement  with  his  imaginary  friend  when  he  found  an  old 
phonograph turntable and a long play vinyl record.  The diameter is 12 inches.  The unused center containing the 
hole, label, etc. has a diameter of 4 inches.  The record has a smooth out ring which is 1 inch wide around the 
whole record.  If the grooves equal 91 to the inch, how far does the needle travel while playing the entire first 
side? 
 
 

 
 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - Even though it hurt Alex\xe2\x80\x99s head to think about it - The number of grooves per inch is meaningless since the needle only moves sideways.  So the distance traveled is three inches.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-09-03-2015-09-03.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-09-03-2015-09-03.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-09-03-2015-09-03.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-09-03-2015-09-03.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-09-03-2015-09-03.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Warning!  It's trickier than it looks at first glance - A dog and cat together weigh 27 pounds.  
If the dog's weight is an odd number, and if he weighs twice as much as she does, how much does each weigh?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer to cats and dogs - The thing that made this tricky is that in cartoons and before political correctness  - felines were portrayed as females and canines as currish males.

pays $8 and leaves with his purchase and then d again at the next store.  Once again buying an $8 item.  At the 
third store he repeats the "borrow and buy" but after this $8  purchase he has no  money left.   How much did 
Tom start out with?

Today's  Question  -  And,  I  thought  the  census  questionnaire  was  tough!    Tony  asked  Peter,  "How  old  is  your 
son?"  Peter replied,  "My son is 5 times as old as my daughter and my wife is 5 times as old as my son.  I am 
twice as old as my wife and her great aunt, who is 81, is as old as all of us put together."  How old is Peter's son?

Today’s Question Here's a weighty problem - Billy got a job in a deep sea fishing supply shop.  They have 10 bins 
with lead weights of various shapes.  The weights in 9 of the bins all weigh exactly 1 pound (16 oz.).  The weights 
in the remaining bin all weigh exactly 17 ounces.  Bill's new boss gives him a challenge.  Using a single scale that 
weighs in pounds and ounces (up to 99lb. 15 oz.), tell which bin has the 17 ounce weights - in only one 
weighing.  (You can use as many weights as you want.)  (Hint the solution is elegant, logical and requires no 
algebra.) 

 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>   Answer - As we noted, the solution is rather elegant and requires no algebra. The bin you are looking for has the 17 ounce weights (one ounce more than a pound) all other weights are exactly 1 pound.  So....take 1 from bin 1; two from bin 2, etc., etc.  When you place it all on the scale, you read the number of ounces and that's the odd bin.  (Example: If it's bin 2, the scale reads 55 pounds 2 ounces.....if bin 4, it's 55 lbs. 4 oz.)  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-08-21-2015-08-21.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-08-21-2015-08-21.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-08-21-2015-08-21.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-08-21-2015-08-21.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-08-21-2015-08-21.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - A group of seven vagabonds came upon an apple orchard late at night.  They agreed that the 
next morning they would pick all the apples and each would keep what he picked.  Two waited for the others to 
doze off and then set about to pick the apples.  When they were all picked, they divided them in half but had 
one left over.  Their bickering awoke a third.  They divided by three but there was one left over.   A fourth awoke 
and  again  equal  division  had  one  left  over.    The  same  thing  happened  when  shared  by  five  or  six  –  there  was 
always one left over.  Only when all seven shared equally was there no remainder.  What is the smallest number 
of apples that could have produced these results – divided by any number from two through six and leaving one 
leftover?  
 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer  \xe2\x80\x93 To solve the vagabond\xe2\x80\x99s apple problem you could start with two assumptions.  First, it had to be an odd number (or it would have easily been divided by the first two).  Second, it had to be a multiple of seven since that was the only time there was not \xe2\x80\x9cone\xe2\x80\x9d left over.  I first shot to 49 which didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite work.  The answer lay much further down the multiplication table.  The number is 301.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-08-13-2015-08-13.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-08-13-2015-08-13.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-08-13-2015-08-13.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-08-13-2015-08-13.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-08-13-2015-08-13.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

That would mean he lost 20% on one ($600 is 80% of what number = $750) and made 20% on the other ($600 is 120% of what number = $500).  Thus he got back $1200 for the 2 items for which he paid $1250.  So he lost $50 overall.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-08-04-2015-08-04.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-08-04-2015-08-04.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-08-04-2015-08-04.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-08-04-2015-08-04.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-08-04-2015-08-04.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's  Question  -  The  Dowry  Boys  -  the  cranky  old  King  told  a  roomful  of  suitors  -  "a  part  of  my  daughter's 
dowry is this large sack of matched rubies.  If you were to frame her throne with these rubies using two to a row, 
you would have 1 ruby left over.  The same would be true of rows of 3, 4, 5 or 6.  Each would have 1 ruby left 
over.  Only rows of 7 would use all.  He who tells me therefore, how many rubies in the sack wins the dowry and 
princess."  How many rubies in the sack?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - (The Dowry Boys) - Many of you apparently thought the king far richer than we assumed, therefore, you found a higher functioning number (721 was a choice).  The number we assumed was the lowest possible (301).    <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-08-03-2015-08-03.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-08-03-2015-08-03.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-08-03-2015-08-03.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-08-03-2015-08-03.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-08-03-2015-08-03.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's  Question  -  Jonathan  the  intern  made  it  through  half  the  summer.    But  with  the  mid-point  passing,  he 
shot himself in the foot.  He confronted his supervisor - "You told me to put the confirms in the folders.  If I put 
one confirm in each folder, I've got one confirm too many.  But if I put two confirms per folder I have one folder 
too many."  How many confirms and folders did Jonathan have to confront? 
 

 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - Poor Jonathan, obviously had been asked to put four confirms in three folders.  Wait till he confronts fractal geometry - or the IRS. 210K 5.3% 34.5 hrs. 0.2% $17.4 bln.                          <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-07-31-2015-07-31.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-07-31-2015-07-31.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-07-31-2015-07-31.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-07-31-2015-07-31.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-07-31-2015-07-31.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's  Question  -  Talk  about  dysfunctional  families  -  at  the  mini-reunion  there  was  an  aunt,  uncle,  niece, 
nephew, cousin, sister, brother, daughter, son, father and mother.  The puzzle is there are only two women and 
two men in the room.  If they all have a common ancestor but no one is married to a blood relative, how is this 
possible?
