Today's Question - In the phrase TWO x TWO = THREE each letter stands for a digit (the x is the multiplication sign).  
What digits make it correct mathematically? 
 

 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - To make the equation - "Two x Two = Three" correct the numbers would be:  138 x 138 = 19044.  (The E\'s had to be 4 because 44 is the only double digit that can end a square.)  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2016-01-12-2016-01-12.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2016-01-12-2016-01-12.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2016-01-12-2016-01-12.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2016-01-12-2016-01-12.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2016-01-12-2016-01-12.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - I P R U A E M O T N T is an odd set of letters.  It is a nagging problem to make a word of these 
letters.    One  word  might  be  "importunate"  (naggingly  solicitous).    Can  you  transform  the  letters  into  a  more 
common word?  (Hint: The change may be strange but not impossible.)

Today’s Question - Kevin is a big West Point sports fan.  He is invited into an informal fraternity of Army fans.  To 
pass the initiation, he must pass the "Black and Gold" test.  He is presented with three cloth bags, each is marked 
"Black"; "Gold" and "Either".  One bag contains only black coins, one only gold coins and the third bag has both.  
He is told all the bags are incorrectly marked.  Assuming he cannot see beyond the coin he chooses - what is the 
fewest number of choices he must make to re-label the bags correctly?

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - Kevin  should go  directly to the "Either"  bag.  Since it\'s labeled incorrectly, it must be all black or all gold. Assume he finds a gold coin.  Now he must swap the Either label with the "Gold" label.  What about the other bag?  Since it could not have been labeled correctly and we now know "Gold" is correct.  Thus he should swap the Either label with the Black.  (We hope he gets seats on the 50 yard line.)  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2016-01-06-2016-01-06.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2016-01-06-2016-01-06.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2016-01-06-2016-01-06.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2016-01-06-2016-01-06.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2016-01-06-2016-01-06.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - This is too cheesy for par - At a post-Christmas party, Tucker rattled three dice in a cup.  When 
he rolled, the total on the three dice was a two digit number.  The number on top of one of the dice was the sum of 
two digits in the total.  The numbers on the bottoms of the other two dice were the two digits of the total.  What 
did Tucker throw? 
 
Bonus Question - We all sing "Auld Lang Syne" at New Year....What language is it and what does it mean?

Today's Question - One of the key features of the Christmas story is the Three Wise Men.  What were their names?  
Who brought what? And what is a Magi?? 
 
 

 

 

 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer  - The legend of the Magi does not appear in writings of the early Church.  It was, however, a big item in the Middle Ages.  According to sources:  Melchior - was the oldest.  Said to be the Emperor of Arabia, he brought "gold".  Caspar - was the youngest.  Said to be the King of Tharsis, a very prosperous trade center in what is now Turkey, he brought Frankincense, sign of honor.  Balthazar was thought the wisest.   Thought to have been King of Ethiopia, he brought Myrrh, a rare resin of a tree in his kingdom.  It was used in anointing and as a balm for battle wounds.  The Magi - The name given to the priests of the Ancient Medes (Iran - pre Persians).  Later a phrase for \xe2\x80\x9cwise man\xe2\x80\x9d mainly used on astrologers.  The term Magi gave us our word for "magic" - something beyond our understanding.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-21-2015-12-21.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-12-21-2015-12-21.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-21-2015-12-21.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-12-21-2015-12-21.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-21-2015-12-21.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - "Where's Santa when you need him."  -  Little Dick and Jane went to the neighborhood five 
and dime to get a Christmas present for mom.   Dick  saw a shiny comb and took  it to the register with all his 
money.  "Sorry little boy", said the cashier.  "You are 24 cents short!"  Jane smiled a sibling grin, grabbed the 
comb and put it, along with all her money on the counter.  "Sorry, little girl", said the cashier, "but you are 2 
cents short."  After an exchange of ugly faces, they agreed to pool their money.  However, the cashier told them

Today's  Question  -  A  traveling  Knight  found  himself  lost  and  hungry  on  the  road  to  Coventry.    Two  pilgrims 
happened along.  One had 5 long loaves of bread and the other had 3.  The 3 agreed to share the bread equally.  
After they ate, the Knight gave them 8 silver coins and left.  How should the pilgrims split the money? 
 

 

 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - The temptation is to split the eight coins 5 and 3.  But the Pilgrims didn't sell the loaves to the Knight they all shared equally.  So 8 loaves divided among 3 people is 2 2/3 loaves apiece.  Thus, the Pilgrim with 3 loaves only had to give in 1/3 loaf.  The fellow with 5 had to give in 2 1/3 loaves (7/3).  So the split is 7 and 1.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-10-2015-12-10.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-12-10-2015-12-10.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-10-2015-12-10.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-12-10-2015-12-10.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-10-2015-12-10.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Kids sometimes send secret messages using numbers for letters.  Math students do the reverse.  
Solve  the  following  math  problem  in  which  letters  substitute  for  numbers.    (Hints  -  logic  is  more  important  than 
math and if you give a letter a value, it must keep that value all through the problem - so if V = 6, it always equals 
6).

Today’s Question – A brag gone bad.  Da boys were talking about how they were still in shape.  Some claimed 
they were still at “wrestling weight” and could run as fast and jump as high as in their youth.  One pot-bellied 
participant challenged the loudest claimant.  “Okay, hot shot.  Give me that ballpoint pen in your pocket and I’ll 
bet you $20 that you are in such bad shape you can’t jump over it.”  He got the pen, put it on the floor and won 
the bet.  It was very easy.  Do you know how?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - Some opted for the easy - Start both together.  When 7 ran out, start the boiling.  When 11 runs out (4 minutes), turn over and get 11 more (15 minutes).  The fallacy here is that you can boil at any instant you choose.  You really have to wait till the boiling process is ready.   Okay, once the poultice is ready to boil start both the 7 minute and 11 minute timers.  When the 7 minutes is done turn it over.  (Elapsed time 7 minutes.)  When the 11 minutes is done turn the 7 over again.  (There will be exactly 4 minutes in the bottom before you turn it over.  So when that runs out the 15 minutes are up.  11 minutes + 4 minutes = 15).  More fun than SAT's huh?  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-03-2015-12-03.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-12-03-2015-12-03.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-03-2015-12-03.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-12-03-2015-12-03.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-03-2015-12-03.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Capital Punishment - We already know you memorized the state capitals in grammar school.  So, 
you should be able to answer this without looking anything up.  There are four state capitals that begin with the 
same letter as their state.  What are they? 
 
Further Goldwynims - "I'll believe in this color television when I see it in black and white!" - "If I could drop dead 
right now, I'd be the happiest man alive." - "I'm willing to admit I may not be right all the time…..but I'm never 
wrong." - "A verbal contract ain't worth the paper it's written on." 
 
And Three Classic Stengelisms - "They say you can't do it…..but sometimes it doesn't always work."  And "Three 
things can happen when you play baseball.  You can win.  You can lose.  Or it can rain.”  Lastly, my favorite Casey 
line – "The key to leadership is to keep the guys who hate you away from the guys who haven't made up their mind 
yet."  
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - The state capitals that begin with the same letter as their states are: Dover (Delaware); Honolulu (Hawaii); Indianapolis (Indiana); Oklahoma City (Oklahoma).  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-02-2015-12-02.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-12-02-2015-12-02.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-02-2015-12-02.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-12-02-2015-12-02.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-02-2015-12-02.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today’s Question – I’m thinking of a number.  If I gave you some clues can you guess what it is?  The number has 3 
digits.  If you add the digits the sum is 19.  The digit on the left is 3 times the number on the right.  If you wrote the 
3 digits in reverse order, the new number would be lower than the original by 594.  What is the original 3-digit 
number? 
 
 
 
 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - The 3 digit number would be "973" which many of you said was "too easy."  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-01-2015-12-01.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-12-01-2015-12-01.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-01-2015-12-01.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-12-01-2015-12-01.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-12-01-2015-12-01.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question –Bobby was looking at a piece of property up in the "Vineyard".  It was subject to a 99 year lease.  
How much time is left, he asked. The less than friendly leaseholder said "Two-thirds of the time past equals four-
fifths of the time yet to go."  How much time is left on the lease?  
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - Bobby, with help from a calculator discovered the 99 year lease would be 54 years old with 45 left to go.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-11-30-2015-11-30.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-11-30-2015-11-30.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-11-30-2015-11-30.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-11-30-2015-11-30.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-11-30-2015-11-30.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>
