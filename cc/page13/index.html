Today's  Question  -  Kids  sometimes  send  secret  messages  using  numbers  for  letters.    Math  students  do  the 
reverse.    Solve  the  following  math  problem  in  which  letters  substitute  for  numbers.    (Hints  -  logic  is  more 
important than math and if you give a letter a value, it must keep that value all through the problem - so if V = 6, 
it always equals 6).

Today's Question - An encore classic to prepare for the holiday season - Ann is stranded in a mountain cabin with 
her husband who has just been bitten by a venomous snake.  Just before the phone went dead, the doctor told 
her the only way to save him was with a poultice that must be boiled exactly 15 minutes (no more, no less).  Ann 
has no watch, clock, radio or other means to time things.  She does have 2 mini-hour glasses, one runs 11 
minutes, the other runs 7 minutes.  How does she time 15 minutes exactly? 
 
 

APOLOGIES FOR NO COMMENTS LAST FRIDAY 

COMPUTER ISSUES. 

 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - Some opted for the easy - Start both together.  When 7 ran out, start the boiling.  When 11 runs out (4 minutes), turn over and get 11 more (15 minutes).  The fallacy here is that you can boil at any instant you choose.  You really have to wait till the boiling process is ready.  Okay, once the poultice is ready to boil start both the 7 minute and 11 minute timers.  When the 7 minutes is done turn it over.  (Elapsed time 7 minutes.)  When the 11 minutes is done turn the 7 over again.  (There will be exactly 4 minutes in the bottom before you turn it over.  So when that runs out the 15 minutes are up.  11 minutes + 4 minutes = 15).  More fun than SAT's huh?  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2017-12-04-2017-12-04.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-12-04-2017-12-04.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2017-12-04-2017-12-04.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-12-04-2017-12-04.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2017-12-04-2017-12-04.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - If the turkey weighed 8 pounds plus one-third its own weight then the 8 pounds represents 2/3rds of the weight.

Today’s Question – Why is Thanksgiving always on a Thursday?

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - Thanksgiving is on a Thursday because - Well in a way - because that\'s when the Pilgrims had it.  Not at first  of  course  -  the  First  Thanksgiving  was  a  three-day  event.   Then  for  many  decades  it  was  different  days  in different places.  Finally, New Englanders put it on "Lecture Day" (Thursday) to avoid conflict with the Sabbath but keep a religious note.  (Lecture Day was that day of week when preachers would circulate to read or lecture to the people.  Sometimes the preacher was not a trained and ordained minister.  Rather he might be the only one in the village who could read and write.  That made him the \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d to go to for help and advice.  The 16th and 17th century British pronunciation of \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d sounded liked \xe2\x80\x9cparson\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xa6.a name we find synonymous with  preacher.)  Washington  kept  the  tradition  when  he  declared  the  first  national  Thanksgiving  and  most Presidents  followed  suit.    Finally,  FDR  and  Congress  wrote  it  into  law  as  the  fourth  Thursday  in  November  to lengthen the Christmas Shopping Season coming out of the Depression.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2017-11-20-2017-11-20.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-11-20-2017-11-20.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2017-11-20-2017-11-20.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-11-20-2017-11-20.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2017-11-20-2017-11-20.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Little Charlie finally retired with his savings.  For the first quarter of his life he saved quarters.  
The next fifth of his life he saved $5 bills.  The next third of his life he saved $20 bills.  In the 13 years before he 
retired he saved $100 bills.  How old is Charlie as he retires.  (Bet you thought we were going to ask how much 
he had saved??) 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - Little Charlie would be 60.  Several folks reported confusion.  If you add up the fractions 1/4; 1/5; 1/3, you get 47/60.

Today's Question - An old refrain - "Twice four and twenty blackbirds were sitting on a plain.  I shot and killed a 
seventh part.  How many did remain?" 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - The centuries old refrain was - "Twice four and twenty blackbirds were sitting on a plain.  I shot and killed a seventh part.  How many did remain?".  Even then (or especially then) riddles involved trickery.  So the clue could be interpreted a couple of ways.  "Twice four and twenty"......could be "2 times 4 plus twenty" or 2 times "4 and 20 (24)".  Obviously to make the riddle work it was "2 times 4" plus twenty (or 28).  So...."I shot and killed a seventh part (1/7)....How many did remain?"  Thus (2x4) + 20 = 28 of which 1/7 = 4 and whether shot by gun or arrow only the dead would remain = 4.....Phew!!

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - First let's repeat the question - This is too cheesy for par - At a  post-Halloween party, Tucker rattled three dice in a cup.  When he rolled, the total on the three dice was a two digit number.  The number on top of one of the dice was the sum of two digits in the total.  The numbers on the bottoms of the other two dice were the two digits of the total. What did Tucker throw?  Okay, so if the two digits in the total are represented on the bottom of two dice, we know they must be digits from 1 through 6. Thus the universe of 2 digit possibilities is 11 through 16.  One of the components is the sum of the two digits.  The other components are equal to 7 minus one of the digits (opposite sides of a die add up to 7).  Therefore, the total is 14 and the components are 5, 6, 3.  See it's easy!!  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2017-11-07-2017-11-07.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-11-07-2017-11-07.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2017-11-07-2017-11-07.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-11-07-2017-11-07.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2017-11-07-2017-11-07.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Are we related??  Which one of these words fails to match the standards of the others:  
"Brother-in-law, Mother, Sibling, Grandfather, Aunt?"  Pick one!  (Although there are two possible answers 
based on different criteria. 

 

 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - Okay!  There were two answers.  All but "brother-in-law" could be blood relatives (in most civilized areas).  We, however, were leaning to "sibling" the only term whose gender was not obvious.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2017-10-31-2017-10-31.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-10-31-2017-10-31.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2017-10-31-2017-10-31.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-10-31-2017-10-31.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2017-10-31-2017-10-31.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - A kid's trick for Halloween – Mike gave Bob a nickel and a dime.  He said - "Put one in each 
hand but don't tell me.  Now....triple the value of the coin in your right hand and double the value in your left.  
Add those two values together and tell me if the total is "odd" or "even" and I'll tell you which coin is in which 
hand."  What would be the placement for "even?" 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary>  Answer - Guess which hand! - If the total is "even", the nickel must be in the hand that is doubled.....in this case the "left hand."  If the nickel were tripled (15 cents), the answer will always be odd.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2017-10-30-2017-10-30.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-10-30-2017-10-30.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2017-10-30-2017-10-30.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2017-10-30-2017-10-30.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2017-10-30-2017-10-30.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>
