Today's Question - Let's make a deal - Bob the Bridge Junkie deals three cards face down from a well shuffled 
deck.  To the right of a King there are one or two Queens.  To the left of a Queen there are one or two Queens.  
To the left of a Heart there are one or two Spades.  To the right of a Spade there are one or two Spades.  What 
are the three cards? 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - The three cards would be the King of Spades, Queen of Spades, and Queen of Hearts (not necessarily in that order).  You can solve it by separating the suits from the rank.  The ranks could only be KQQ or QKQ.  The suits only SHS or SSH.  The combo shows the answer.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-04-10-2015-04-10.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-04-10-2015-04-10.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-04-10-2015-04-10.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-04-10-2015-04-10.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-04-10-2015-04-10.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Step aside please! - One of these words is different from the others, which one is it?   (A little 
tricky.) 
 
 
 

"Divide, Orator, Avenue, Animal, Safari" 

 

 

 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - In the series: "Divide, Orator, Avenue, Animal, Safari" the odd one out is Avenue since it is the only one that does not continue to alternate vowels and consonants.  Some might contend "Divide" does not belong since it is a verb.  However, it is also a noun - as in "The Great Divide."  Divide does get honorable mention as the only two syllable word.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-04-09-2015-04-09.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-04-09-2015-04-09.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-04-09-2015-04-09.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-04-09-2015-04-09.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-04-09-2015-04-09.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - It's in the bag - An eccentric trader took his $1,000 bonus to the bank.  He asked the teller to 
place the dollars in a series of sealed bags so that he could later ask for any amount from 1 to 1,000 and get it 
without opening any bag.  What is the smallest number of bags he would need and what amounts would in each 
bag?

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer \xe2\x80\x93 Timmy's twin brother, Tommy, nearly popped a staple trying to figure this one.  Skip the algebra and use logic.  Since the number was two times the product of its digits, it had to be an \xe2\x80\x9ceven\xe2\x80\x9d number.  The product had to be under 50 since twice that would be a three digit number.  Also, the number could not have a zero in it since  multiplying  by  zero  equals  zero.    So  our  number  must  be  an  even  two  digit  number  below  50  with  no zeroes.    There  are  other  tricks  that  take  up  too  much  space.    Anyway,  from  the  universe  you  narrowed  you eliminate down to the number 36, which gives you a product of 18, exactly one half its value.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-04-01-2015-04-01.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-04-01-2015-04-01.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-04-01-2015-04-01.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-04-01-2015-04-01.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-04-01-2015-04-01.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today’s Question - A seasonal repeat - Who or what determines when Easter falls each year?  (Hint:  It is based on 
Passover so you get bonus points for answering both.) 

 
 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - The formula for when Easter falls, as you probably know, is that it shall be the first Sunday on, or after, the first full moon following the Vernal Equinox, the first day of Spring.  It was set by the Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D. which as you remember was called by the Emperor Constantine.  Because of the formula's basis in Astronomy, Easter can never be later than April 25 nor earlier than March 22.  Passover, on the other hand is on the 15th day of the month of Nisan.  Now as you may have guessed, the Council of Nicaea suspected that not everyone's calendar, even with the picture of the two kittens climbing out of a basket, would have the month of Nisan on it.  So to avoid bothering their Jewish neighbors by asking each Spring when is the 15th of Nisan, they approximated the date with the above mentioned astronomical formula.  Since the month of Nisan always starts on a new moon (as does every month in the Jewish calendar), the 15th of the month would be at - or proximate to - a full moon.  That's why the two holidays are tied so closely together each year.  This year they are only one day off from their original link.  Passover was on Thursday before the first Easter.  (The Last Supper was, in fact, a Seder or Passover ritual meal.)  This year Passover will start at sundown on Good Friday.  Easter is different for orthodox Christians since they use the old Julian calendar, devised by Julius Caesar.  (Special thanks to Mr. Joseph Berman for his input on the Biblical Lunar Calendar.)  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-31-2015-03-31.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-03-31-2015-03-31.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-31-2015-03-31.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-03-31-2015-03-31.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-31-2015-03-31.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Murray the Master Meatloaf Maker was whipping up some of his famous "mini-loafs" for a 
card  game  ("Smoker's  Poker").    He  usually  made  enough  so  that  each  player  got  three.    But  today  he 
absentmindedly made more.  So, when Pick and Little Simple Shoo made a surprise appearance, there was still 
enough.  Leaving Murray out of the equation, now each person got two.  How many mini-loafs did Murray make 
and how many smokers were originally invited? 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer  -  To  Murray's  Smoker's  Poker  and  the  mini  meatloaf  confusion.    If  all  had  two  apiece,  then  the  two surprise guests ate a total of four.  Since that reduced the other players from three to two (net loss of one each), the four loafs meant four players.  And there were twelve mini-loafs (4 x 3) shared by the guests.  (Heaven only knows what Murray ate.)  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-24-2015-03-24.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-03-24-2015-03-24.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-24-2015-03-24.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-03-24-2015-03-24.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-24-2015-03-24.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Timmy ignored the advice of his mentor Danny and went to an NCAA - March Madness Party 
with an armful of brown bottles.  To his pal Anthony he gives half the bottles he has plus a half bottle.  Next, to 
his  buddy  Bernie,  he  gives  half  the  bottles  he  has  left  plus  half  a  bottle.    Realizing  that  he  can't  live  on  his 
personality  he  then  gives  half  of  what  he  has  left  plus  half  a  bottle  to  his  protector  -  Last  Call.    Timmy  then 
realizes he is out of brown bottles.  How many bottles did Tim start with??

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer \xe2\x80\x93 Timmy started out with seven bottles.  He gave Anthony half of what he had - 3.50 bottles and half a bottle or a total of 4.  He gave Bernie 1.50 + .50 or 2.  Then he gave Last Call .50 + .50 or 1 bottle.    <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-23-2015-03-23.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-03-23-2015-03-23.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-23-2015-03-23.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-03-23-2015-03-23.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-23-2015-03-23.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today’s  Question  -  Timmy  went  into  a  store  and  said  "I'll  buy  that  calculator  for  $10  if  you  lend  me  as  much 
money as I have in my pocket.  The clerk lent him the money and Timmy gave him $10 cash.  He went to the next 
store and bought a $10 cap using the same gambit.  Then he bought a $10 umbrella with the same strategy.  
When he paid for the umbrella, he had no money left.  How much did he start out with?? 

 
 
 
 

</p>
<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - Timmy started with $8.75.  In the first store, he got $8.75 making $17.50.  He spent $10.00 leaving $7.50.  Second store - borrowed $7.50 making $15.00, spent $10.00 leaving $5.00.  Then he borrowed $5.00 making $10.00, spent $10.00 leaving zero.  Timmy may open a hedge fund.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-20-2015-03-20.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-03-20-2015-03-20.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-20-2015-03-20.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-03-20-2015-03-20.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-20-2015-03-20.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today’s Question - Little Staten Island House on the Prairie – In honor of St. Joseph’s Day - sort of.  Sal, brother Al 
and sister Val show up at Nino's sharpeners.  Nino's two nephews are on duty.  They both work at exactly the same 
pace.  Sal, Al and Val each need one hacksaw sharpened and one "penknife" sharpened.  If it takes 15 minutes to 
sharpen one hacksaw and 5 minutes to sharpen one "penknife"; what is the best division of labor for the nephews 
to choose?

blessed  with  Italian  ancestry  don't  mind,  the

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - Okay!  So they all shared equally and thus ate two soda breads apiece.  So....Grandma and her two sons had a total of 6 (or 2 each).  Of these, 2 came from the "surprise" extras.  So that left 4 breads that represented the grandchildren getting 2 instead of 3 apiece.  That means there were 4 grandchildren and a total of 14 cakes (4 x 3 +"2").  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-16-2015-03-16.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-03-16-2015-03-16.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-16-2015-03-16.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-03-16-2015-03-16.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-03-16-2015-03-16.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

the  3rd  reversed  those  numbers  and  said  "43".    Coach  Sullivan  grunted  and  said  -  "One  of  you  was  off  by  6, 
another by 1 and another by 3".  What was the correct number??

<details><summary>Reveal Answer</summary> Corner  Answer - It was simple!  Assume the three games Billy won were the first three.  Dick would then need three games to break even plus three more to win the $3.  So they played nine games.  <p> </p><a href="mailto:hi+doesntmatch@cravol.com?subject=2015-02-23-2015-02-23.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscript/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-02-23-2015-02-23.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Doesn't match</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+missinginfo@cravol.com?subject=2015-02-23-2015-02-23.markdown&amp;body=/root/cashinscrip/cashin.sh - rm /web/cashin/jekyll/cc/_posts/2015-02-23-2015-02-23.markdown [sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Missing info</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hi+like@cravol.com?subject=2015-02-23-2015-02-23.markdown&amp;body=[sub]" onclick="this.href = this.href.replace('[sub]',window.location)">Like question</a></details>

Today's Question - Time on my hands - Teddy Gee and Jackie Dee, two great athletes, decide to have a race.  The 
distance is 3 miles.  Jackie runs half the time needed then walks the rest. Teddy runs half the distance then walks the 
rest.  Who gets to the finish line first?
